REDRAWN IS DEAD. DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE FROM US

The truth is, Redrawn was just one silly experiment that was born out of the fact that octanuary (stupid bitch) added RegularSpark to his dev team (ew) so we decided to make Redrawn as a response. It evolutioned out of that, and we grew to an at least decent LVM, compared to what Wrapper: Offline was back then. However, we encountered major issues on the way, one which was so big we literally had to replace the entire codebase... which did not get rid of the issue. And personal issues as well, such as school, other projects, drunk dads ruining the fun (this only applies to me) and other shit.

So i hope you all liked Redrawn while it lasted, Goodbye.


anyways just fucking let goanimate die, there's no point on keeping it alive if the community is full of fucking retards who love harassing people over the tiniest mistake.
